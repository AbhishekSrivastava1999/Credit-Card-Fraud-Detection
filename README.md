# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using Python and scikit-learn. The project utilizes logistic regression to model and identify suspicious activities from credit card transaction data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Main programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn` for modeling and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's "Credit Card Fraud Detection," includes transactions made by credit cards, labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Features include transaction amount, time, and 28 PCA-transformed features.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze transaction distributions and feature correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to handle imbalanced data.
- **Modeling**: Logistic regression is employed to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report for model performance.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data and results for intuitive understanding.
