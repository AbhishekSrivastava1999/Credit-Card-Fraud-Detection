# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using Python and scikit-learn. The project utilizes logistic regression to model and identify suspicious transactions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where 492 out of 284,807 transactions were fraudulent. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
